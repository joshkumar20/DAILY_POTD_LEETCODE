// You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

// You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

// Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "aababbab"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: You can either:
// Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
// Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
// Example 2:

// Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.
