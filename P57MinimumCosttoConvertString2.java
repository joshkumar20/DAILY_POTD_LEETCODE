// You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English characters. You are also given two 0-indexed string arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of converting the string original[i] to the string changed[i].

// You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a substring x from the string, and change it to y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y. You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions:

// The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with either b < c or d < a. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint.
// The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with a == c and b == d. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical.
// Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.

// Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].

 

// Example 1:

// Input: source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
// Output: 28
// Explanation: To convert "abcd" to "acbe", do the following operations:
// - Change substring source[1..1] from "b" to "c" at a cost of 5.
// - Change substring source[2..2] from "c" to "e" at a cost of 1.
// - Change substring source[2..2] from "e" to "b" at a cost of 2.
// - Change substring source[3..3] from "d" to "e" at a cost of 20.
// The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28. 
// It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
// Example 2:

// Input: source = "abcdefgh", target = "acdeeghh", original = ["bcd","fgh","thh"], changed = ["cde","thh","ghh"], cost = [1,3,5]
// Output: 9
// Explanation: To convert "abcdefgh" to "acdeeghh", do the following operations:
// - Change substring source[1..3] from "bcd" to "cde" at a cost of 1.
// - Change substring source[5..7] from "fgh" to "thh" at a cost of 3. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation.
// - Change substring source[5..7] from "thh" to "ghh" at a cost of 5. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation, and identical with indices picked in the second operation.
// The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
// It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
// Example 3:

// Input: source = "abcdefgh", target = "addddddd", original = ["bcd","defgh"], changed = ["ddd","ddddd"], cost = [100,1578]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: It is impossible to convert "abcdefgh" to "addddddd".
// If you select substring source[1..3] as the first operation to change "abcdefgh" to "adddefgh", you cannot select substring source[3..7] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.
// If you select substring source[3..7] as the first operation to change "abcdefgh" to "abcddddd", you cannot select substring source[1..3] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= source.length == target.length <= 1000
// source, target consist only of lowercase English characters.
// 1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 100
// 1 <= original[i].length == changed[i].length <= source.length
// original[i], changed[i] consist only of lowercase English characters.
// original[i] != changed[i]
// 1 <= cost[i] <= 106
